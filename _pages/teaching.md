## Part II/Part III/MPhil Project Supervision

I am supervising Part II, Part III, and MPhil projects. Motivated and highly capable students are welcome to contact me to discuss their project ideas. I am interested in broad topics across machine learning and artificial intelligence. My current research focuses on generative AI, computer vision, and neural rendering. I am also open to discussing other ideas. Please also include your transcript and CV (if you have one) when contacting me.

Some potential project ideas (please contact me for more detailed descriptions and proposals of these ideas; suggestions of your own are more than welcome):  
- <a href="https://openai.com/research/clip" target="_blank">CLIP</a>-related
- Application of frequency rectification techniques used in <a href="https://chenliang-zhou.github.io/FrePolad/" target="_blank">FrePolad</a> on other 3D representations or images
- 3D generation/manipulation
	- Joint generation of 3D scene and human motions with mutual spatial awareness
	- Combine text-driven scene generation and object generation
	- Iterative editing of 3D objects
	- Text-guided <a href="https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de" target="_blank">SMPL</a> (a parametrized human model) manipulation
- (Text-driven) 3D vision tasks (e.g., detection/recognition/captioning/classification/segmentation) via rendering to 2D
- Neural BRDF models (machine learning + graphics)
- Neural rendering
- Extensions and applications of <a href="https://zfc946.github.io/CNF.github.io/" target="_blank">CNF</a>
