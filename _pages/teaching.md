## Part II/Part III/MPhil Project Supervision

I am supervising Part II, Part III, and MPhil projects. The students are welcome to contact me to discuss their project ideas. I am interested in broad topics across machine learning and artificial intelligence. My current research focuses on computer vision, particularly 2D and 3D reconstruction and manipulation. I am also open to discussing other ideas.

Some potential project ideas (suggestions of your own are more than welcome):  
- <a href="https://openai.com/research/clip" target="_blank">CLIP</a>-related
	- Theoretical exploration/analysis of CLIP space
	- Exploration of "object subspace": the subspace formed by different images/3D models of the same object
	- Application of <a href="https://chenliang-zhou.github.io/CLIP-PAE/" target="_blank">CLIP-PAE</a> in other domains such as 3D or video editing
	- 3D version of CLIP (similar work: 3DMM)
	- Interesting tasks at the text end of CLIP (e.g., text generation)
- 3D generation/manipulation
	- Combine text-driven scene generation and object generation
	- Iterative editing of 3D objects
	- Potential improvements to <a href="https://nv-tlabs.github.io/GET3D/" target="_blank">GET3D</a>: multi-class generation, generation using pure image datasets, or text-guided generation
	- Text-guided <a href="https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de" target="_blank">SMPL</a> (a parametrized human model) manipulation
- (Text-driven) 3D vision tasks (e.g., detection/recognition/captioning/classification/segmentation) via rendering to 2D
- A thorough comparison/analysis/summary of the pros & cons of the diffusion model and GAN
- Prompt engineering: analyze prompts to language models (e.g., ChatGPT or text-to-image models) that can 1. facilitate the original task, 2. achieve a certain type of attack (e.g., acquire some private information), or 3. improve the model to defend itself from this attack
- Stock prediction model
