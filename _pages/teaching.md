## Part II/Part III/MPhil Project Supervision

I am supervising Part II, Part III, and MPhil projects. The students are welcome to contact me to discuss their project ideas, especially those related to 2D/3D generation/manipulation.

Some potential project ideas (suggestions of your own are more than welcome):  
- [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip)-related
	- Theoretical exploration/analysis of CLIP space
	- Exploration of "object subspace": the subspace formed by different images/3D models of the same object
	- Application of [CLIP-PAE](https://chenliang-zhou.github.io/CLIP-PAE/) in other domains such as 3D or video editing
	- 3D version of CLIP (similar work: 3DMM)
	- Interesting tasks at the text end of CLIP (e.g., text generation)
- 3D generation/manipulation
	- Combine text-driven scene generation and object generation
	- Iterative editing of 3D objects
	- Potential improvements to [GET3D](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/GET3D/assets/paper.pdf): multi-class generation, generation using pure image datasets, or text-guided generation
	- Text-guided [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de) (a parametrized human model) manipulation
- (Text-driven) 3D vision tasks (e.g., detection/recognition/captioning/classification/segmentation) via rendering to 2D
- A thorough analysis/summary of the pros & cons of Diffusion model and GAN

## Students
